            Flixbus is apparently not allowed yet to offer rides inside of Switzerland (Kabotageverbots)
            so they don&#39;t do it but if you buy a ticket to Freiburg in Germany when you&#39;re
            going to Basel from Bern you can just get off in Basel and it&#39;s still much cheaper
            in some cases than paying for the train. The same goes for Zürich if you travel to Lindau
            in Germany or Bregenz in Austria from Bern or to Bern as cheap as 13.50 you can just get off at Zürich.
            No guarantee but it seems like when you look for these rides from Bern and then from Basel/Zürich it shows
            the same arrival time which is a pretty strong indicator, check on the trip tab, it shows all the stops.</li> <li>If you&#39;re very lucky you can maybe find a ride for free in these groups
