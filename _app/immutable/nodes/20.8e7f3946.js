            <a href="https://blablacar.com" target="_blank">https://blablacar.com</a>  
            for around 10 franks. 
            If you are really desperate you can also try blablacar daily and ask 
            the driver if you can come for only one trip.</li> <li>Traveling via Flixbus is also possible inside of Switzerland. 
            It&#39;s illegal for Flixbus to offer rides inside of Switzerland (Kabotageverbots) 
            so they don&#39;t do it but it you buy a ticket to Freiburg in Germany when you&#39;re 
            going to Basel from Bern you can just get off in Basel and it&#39;s still much cheaper 
            in some cases than paying for the train. The same goes for Zürich if you travel to Lindau 
            in Germany or Bregenz in Austria from Bern or to Bern as cheap as 13.50 you can just get off at Zürich. 
            No guarantee but it seems like when you look for these rides from Bern and then from Barrel/Zürich it shows 
            the same arrival time which is a pretty strong indicator, you can also check on the trip tab, it shows all the stops.</li> <li>If you&#39;re very lucky you can maybe find a ride for free in these groups
            To and from Bern:

            sometimes they have an option to send it 
            by post (for example to my place) if you think about it early enough, otherwise you need to 
            go to the place you are buying the ticket from which might be far and also cost money if 
            you don&#39;t want to hitchhike or bike there....</li> <li>If you are under 25 years old, you can travel around switzerland for 
            one year for 99 francs, always after 7pm.
